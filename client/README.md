Selenium:
- Do an 'npm install' to get all of the necessary node_module folders
- Install the appropriate web driver(s) and make sure it's on your PATH. Link for chrome: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- Edit src/tests/LoginTest.js such that constants "EMAIL" and "PW" match the credentials of an existing user in your local database.
- Start up the app locally using 'npm run dev'.
- Once Savnac is up and running locally, try 'node LoginTest.js' or 'node <testFileName>' in order to run the file's automated test sequence.
